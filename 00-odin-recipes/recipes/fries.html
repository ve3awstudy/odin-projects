    <h1>French Fries (How to Make)</h1>

    <img src="pics/fries.webp" alt="Fries" width="400px">

    <p><strong>Learn how to make French fries that are super crispy with this twice-fried
        <br> method. I don't think most people realize that any decent French fry needs to be fried twice. The first frying is done at a lower temperature, which softens the
        <br> potato and prepares the starchy surface for the second frying's crispification.</strong></p>
    
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>

        <ul>
         
            <li>1 large russet potato, cut into evenly sized 
            <br> strips</li>
  
            <br>
             
            <li>
             vegetable oil for frying, about 2 cups or as 
             <br>needed
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                salt to taste
            </li>

        </ul>

         <h1>Directions</h1>

        <h4>Step 1</h4>

        <p><strong> Soak potato strips in a large bowl of water for about 30 minutes.</strong></p>
 
        <h4>
            Step 2
        </h4>

        <p><strong> Pat with paper towels until thoroughly dry.</strong></p>

      <h4>
        Step 3
      </h4>

      <p><strong> Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).
        <br> Gently add potatoes to the hot oil and fry for about 5 minutes, stirring and
        <br> flipping the potatoes occasionally.</strong></p>

        <h4>Step 4</h4>

        <p><strong> Use a slotted spoon to transfer potatoes to a paper towel-lined plate. Let cool
            <br> completely.</strong></p>

            <h4>Step 5</h4>

            <p><strong> Heat oil again, but this time to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Add potatoes and
                <br> fry a second time until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes.</strong></p>

                <h4>Step 6</h4>

                <p><strong> Remove from the deep-fryer and blot with a paper towel. Sprinkle with salt to
                    <br> serve.</strong></p>

                 <h4>Step 7</h4>  
                 
                 <p><strong>Enjoy!</strong></p>
