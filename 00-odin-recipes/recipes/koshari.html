    <p><strong>Koshary is pretty much Egypt's staple street food. You can find anything from a 2-story koshary restaurant to a man with a cart on the side of the street. It has no meat, but even the biggest of carnivores don't miss it.</strong></p>

    <h1>Directions</h1>
       
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
      <p><strong> Combine chickpeas, vinegar, coriander, cayenne pepper, and cumin in <br> 
        a resealable bag or container with a tight-fitting lid. Store in refrigerator while
        <br> prepping remainder of dish, shaking occasionally. </strong></p>
       <br>
         
       <h4>Step 2</h4>

      <p><strong>
        Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook pasta in the boiling
        <br> water until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain and set 
        <br>aside. 
      </strong></p>
      <br>

      <h4>Step 3</h4>

      <p><strong>
        Combine rice with enough cold water to cover; allow to soak for 20 minutes. 
        <br> Drain. 
      </strong></p>
       <br>
          
       <h4>Step 4</h4>

      <p><strong>
        Meanwhile, combine lentils with enough water to cover in a pot; season with
        <br> salt and pepper. Bring the lentils to a boil and simmer until tender, about 30
        <br> minutes. Drain. 
      </strong></p>
      <br>
  
       <h4>Step 5</h4>

      <p><strong>
        Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat; cook and stir onion and
        <br> garlic in hot oil until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes; season
        <br> with salt and pepper, reduce heat to medium-low, and maintain at a simmer
        <br> while preparing remainder of dish. 
      </strong></p>
       <br>

         <h4>Step 6</h4>

      <p><strong>
        Melt butter in a pot over medium-high heat; add rice, increase heat to high, and
        <br> fry for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Pour in chicken stock and bring to a 
        <br> boil. Season with salt and pepper; reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until rice
        <br> is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, about 20 minutes. 
      </strong></p>
      <br>

   <h4>Step 6</h4>
     <p><strong>
        Mix rice and lentils together on a large serving platter. Spread cooked pasta over
        <br> the rice and lentil mixture. Serve with marinated chickpeas, tomato sauce,
        <br> and French-fried onions. 
     </strong></p>
     <br>

     <h1>Tips</h1>
     <p><strong>
        Instead of French-fried onions, you can caramelize 4 large sliced onions in butter
        <br> and brown sugar for 45 minutes and serve with both kinds of onion. It's
        <br> sensational!
